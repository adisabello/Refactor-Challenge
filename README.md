# Code Refactor Starter Code
# Navigation
I modified the navigation bar to shrink to a menu icon when the screen becomes smaller.
The menu items are hidden and become visible when the menu icon is clicked.
The menu icon toggles the navigtion items to hide or show when clicked

# Content Section
I removed the fixed height from the divs in the content section.
When the screen becomes smaller, the images and text are aligned to the center, 
removing any float directive that was there before

# Benefits Section
When the screen becomes too small to hold the content and benefits section alongside
each other, the benefits section aligns itself to the middle of the screen 

# IMG tags and HTML
I added necessary alt tags to all image tags and went over the html to make sure everything
was according to the current HTML standards

# JS
I added a java script file to handle the menu icon click
